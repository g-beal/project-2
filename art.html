  <h1>Some of my art!</h1>
  <p>I enjoy drawing and illustration. Here are some drawings that I've done over the past year!</p>
  <img src="art_photos/art_photo_1.png" alt="A little guy in the woods!">
  <img src="art_photos/art_photo_2.png" alt="A little guy drinking forbidden soup and seeing the secrets of the universe.">
  <img src="art_photos/art_photo_3.png" alt="Four different little guys in different enviroments.">
  <img src="art_photos/art_photo_4.png" alt="Two creatures watching a third.">
  <img src="art_photos/art_photo_5.png" alt="A creature carrying a city on its back!">
  <img src="art_photos/art_photo_6.png" alt="A cutout of a creature carrying a little guy on its back.">
  <img src="art_photos/art_photo_7.png" alt="A little guy in the woods!">
  <img src="art_photos/art_photo_8.png" alt="A creature drinking from a waterfall!">
  <p>I am quite a fan of the creature theme. These pieces (save the first, which is acrylic paint on canvas) are all ink and/or watercolor on paper.</p>
